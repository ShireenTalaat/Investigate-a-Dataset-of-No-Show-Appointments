ntroduction
This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question:
of whether or not patients show up for their appointment.
A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row:

● ‘ScheduledDay’ tells us on what day the patient set up their appointment.

● ‘Neighborhood’ indicates the location of the hospital.

● ‘Scholarship’ indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program Bolsa Família.

● The last column 'No-show': it says ‘No’ if the patient showed up to their appointment, and ‘Yes’ if they did not show up


Conclusions
By analyzing this dataset we can find that the percetage of no-show patients is 20.2 % which is considered high. However, there are some limitations will be mentioned bellow.

Limitations:
The data set is over a 6 month period. Data for a longer timeframe would be much better as it would provide more insight into how seasonality affect show rates.
There were some data such as patients with age 0 or less which does not make sense.
Adding some information like if the patient is covered by medical insurance or not, employed or not would beneficial.
Findings and results:
Average age of attended patients is 37.7 years, and the average age for unattended patients is 34 years.
It seems that female patients do not show to their appointment more than male patients, however the difference is minor.
The neighborhood that has the highest number of no-shows is ILHAS OCEÃ‚NICAS DE TRINDADE
Appointment no-shows occurred the most on third day which is Wednesday and the least on 4th da which is Thursdays.
Patients with health issues were invistgated using charts to check if there was a large difference between the no-shows and shows. Hypertension was the largest category in both segments.
By checking if scholarship affects the pattient attendance it turns out that most of patients who has Scholarship are most likely to miss thier appointments.
